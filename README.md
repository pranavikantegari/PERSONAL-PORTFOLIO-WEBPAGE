DESCRIPTION:For this project, I created a basic personal portfolio website using just HTML and CSS. The goal was to build a clean, one-page layout where a web developer like myself can showcase their work, talk a bit about who they are, and give people an easy way to get in touch. It’s simple, responsive, and gets the job done without any unnecessary bells and whistles.The website has a fixed navigation bar at the top with links that smoothly scroll to different sections of the page: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. It’s built using anchor links that point to different ids on the page, which makes navigating super intuitive, even on mobile devices.Each section has its own purpose. The Home section has a quick welcome and intro. The About section is where you can talk about your background, what you’re passionate about, or anything that gives visitors a better sense of who you are. The Projects section showcases the kind of work you’ve done,each project is displayed in a card-style layout with a title and description. Finally, the Contact section gives people a way to reach out, usually with an email address.Styling is done entirely with CSS. The look is clean and minimal, with clear spacing, easy-to-read fonts, and responsive layouts so it looks good on both desktop and mobile. I used Flexbox and Grid to keep everything aligned nicely, especially for the project cards, which automatically adjust based on screen size. There’s even a sticky header so the navigation bar stays in place as you scroll.One small detail I wanted to include was the ability to show code snippets in a neat and readable way. That’s where the <pre> tag comes in. By default, text inside a <pre> tag uses a monospace font like Courier, which is fine—but you can easily change it to something more modern and stylish using CSS.
For example, you can write: (font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace) within the pre tag.
This makes any code or preformatted text on the site look much cleaner, which is especially useful if you’re showing off any technical work.
Overall, this portfolio site is a great starting point. It’s simple, easy to customize, and looks professional without being over-designed. It’s also a solid foundation to build on if I want to add more features later, like a blog, contact form, or light/dark theme. For now, it’s a straightforward way to show the world who I am and what I do.
